# Packrat - Package Management in R

Package specifications are detailed in the file `packrat.lock`.  
Each new package installation is immediately updated within this file.

The packages that are automatically installed via **packrat** in a newly created project include:

  * _dplyr_
  * _magrittr_
  * _ggplot2_

and their dependencies

The usage of **packrat** is inherently prompted when you initialize your project with _cookiecutter_.  
However, if you want to modify some advanced settings (like loading `R` packages from external resources)  
you can read more about **packrat** [here](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/ "packrat home page")
